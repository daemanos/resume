\opening{To whom it may concern,}

I am writing this letter to apply for one of your open Software Engineering
Intern positions. I learned of this position through my school's career service
center and believe that my skillset could uniquely benefit the Corporation.

I have always been fascinated by computers and their workings, which led me to
develop a broad range of proficiency in a variety of software engineering
disciplines. My time at the Rochester Institute of Technology has helped me to
deepen this proficiency which will in turn, I hope, allow me to apply this
skillset to the benefit of the Corporation in any and all of its software
engineering needs. I have always strived to be as general-purpose as possible,
adapting best to whatever situation I find myself in, and so I believe that I
could excel at many of the Corporation's software development areas. My
attached résumé details my existing skills, but these can be extended and I
strive to do so constantly.

If possible, I would like to set up a personal interview so that my suitability
to both the position of Software Engineer and to the Corporation at large can
be better judged. I can be contacted at my personal phone number,
+1 (412) 586-8168, whenever is suitable. See also my attached résumé for
additional contact details. Thank you for taking the time to consider this
application, and I look forward to hearing from you.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
